#EMBEDDED_NOTES
#Three axle dump truck with a two axle dolly trailer and a two axle dump trailer.
#
#Note that for TruckSim 2018, the modular solver architecture means that this vehicle configuration must be built with the dolly linked on the trailer screen, as opposed to treating the dolly as the first trailer.
#
#In TruckSim, lead units and trailers have an optional frame torsional compliance that is enabled with the TruckSim Frame Torsional Flexibility. However, intermediate trailing units, when linked on the trailer screens as dollies, do not include this Frame Torsional Flexibility.
#
#By linking the dolly on the trailer screen, this removes the degree of freedom from the dolly's sprung mass body associated with the Frame Torsional Flexibility.
