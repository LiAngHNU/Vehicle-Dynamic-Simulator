#EMBEDDED_NOTES
#This dataset shows 1 sphere on the path being previewed by the Driver Model (both steering and speed). It is set up to work with most datasets, including those with complicated road networks.
#
#It uses Symbol Stack variables to specify output variable names used in VS Commands EQ_INIT and EQ_OUT.
#
#The Path ID and Road ID are both set to zero. When this dataset is read, the current road is often not known, so setting the ID to zero prevents an error.
#
#However, during initialization, the Road ID is set to CURRENT_ROAD_ID.  Output X and Y coordinates are always calculated from the DM points, using equations added with EQ_OUT.
