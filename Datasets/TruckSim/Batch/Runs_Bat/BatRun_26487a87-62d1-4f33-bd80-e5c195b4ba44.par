#EMBEDDED_NOTES
#Batch Runs are very useful when large numbers of simulations have to be performed.
#
#This Batch Run dataset includes the TruckSim Run Control examples that do not require a 3rd party tool such as AVL Cruise, COSIN FTire, Matlab / Simulink, LabVIEW, and so on.
#
#Some of the examples in this list require licenses for the TruckSim Sensors and Frame Flex.
