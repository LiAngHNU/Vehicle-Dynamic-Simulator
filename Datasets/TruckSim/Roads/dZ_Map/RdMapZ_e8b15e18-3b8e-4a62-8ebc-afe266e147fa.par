#EMBEDDED_NOTES
#This is the 3D surface for the right lane of a curved road, used in the example 3-way and 4-way intersections.
#
#In the straight sections, the elevation is zero at L = 0 (lane edge and road centerline), dropping to 0.1 at -4.3 m. A curb goes up 0.16m  at -4.6.
#
#In the intersection, the cross-slope is eliminated, and the curb is 0.1 m higher. A transision from straight to intesection occurs for station S between -18 and -8 m, and then back between 8 and 18 m.
#
#Changed for 2018.1: Added custom ID to allow multiple instances.
