! CONFIGURABLE FUNCTIONS
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

! MU_ROAD: Tire/road friction coefficient (MU) for a road surface. Use MU = -1 for
! original tire data (no scaling). MU can be a nonlinear CARPET function of lateral
! position and station or a function of station (CONSTANT or TABLE) combined with a
! function MU_ROAD_L of lateral position (CONSTANT or TABLE). Alternatively, a custom
! equation can be defined at runtime. MU from the calculation can be adjusted with
! MU_ROAD_GAIN and MU_ROAD_OFFSET. Station used in the calculation can be adjusted
! with SSCALE_MU_ROAD and SSTART_MU_ROAD. Lateral position used in the calculation
! can be adjusted with L_SCALE_MU_ROAD and L_START_MU_ROAD. This configurable
! function supports 200 datasets; if indices shown below are not used, e.g., (2), the
! current value of the index IROAD is used to identify the dataset when reading data.
