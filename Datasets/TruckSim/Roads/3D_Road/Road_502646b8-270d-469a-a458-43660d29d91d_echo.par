!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! CONFIGURABLE FUNCTIONS
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

! MU_ROAD: Tire/road friction coefficient (MU) for a road surface. Use MU = -1 for
! original tire data (no scaling). MU can be a nonlinear CARPET function of lateral
! position and station or a function of station (CONSTANT or TABLE) combined with a
! function MU_ROAD_L of lateral position (CONSTANT or TABLE). Alternatively, a custom
! equation can be defined at runtime. MU from the calculation can be adjusted with
! MU_ROAD_GAIN and MU_ROAD_OFFSET. Station used in the calculation can be adjusted
! with SSCALE_MU_ROAD and SSTART_MU_ROAD. Lateral position used in the calculation
! can be adjusted with L_SCALE_MU_ROAD and L_START_MU_ROAD. This configurable
! function supports 200 datasets; if indices shown below are not used, e.g., (2), the
! current value of the index IROAD is used to identify the dataset when reading data.

MU_ROAD_CONSTANT(1) 0.85 ; - ! Constant MU component due to station
MU_ROAD_GAIN(1)     1 ! Gain multiplied with calculated value to get MU
MU_ROAD_OFFSET(1)   0 ; - ! Offset added (after gain) to get MU
MU_ROAD_COMBINE(1) ADD ! How to combine the two components
MU_ROAD_L_CONSTANT(1) 0 ; - ! Constant MU component due to lateral position

! ROAD_NEW_ID: Left/right boundary: 0 -> no boundary, -1 stop when L reaches
! boundary, > 0 ID of adjacent road. ID is a function of S (CONSTANT, COEFFICIENT, or
! TABLE). Alternatively, a custom equation can be defined at runtime. ID from the
! calculation can be adjusted with ROAD_NEW_ID_GAIN and ROAD_NEW_ID_OFFSET. S used in
! the calculation can be adjusted with SSCALE_ROAD_NEW_ID and SSTART_ROAD_NEW_ID.
! This configurable function supports 400 datasets; if indices shown below are not
! used, e.g., (1,2), the current values of the indices IROAD and ISIDE are used to
! identify the dataset when reading data.

ROAD_NEW_ID_CONSTANT(1,1) 0 ; - ! [D] Constant ID, Road 1, left side boundary
ROAD_NEW_ID_OFFSET(1,1) 0 ; - ! Offset added (after gain) to get ID

ROAD_NEW_ID_OFFSET(1,2) 0 ; - ! Offset added (after gain) to get ID

! ROAD_ZS: Road elevation component related only to road station S. Elevation is a
! function of station (CONSTANT, COEFFICIENT, or TABLE). Elevation from the
! calculation can be adjusted with ROAD_ZS_GAIN and ROAD_ZS_OFFSET. Station used in
! the calculation can be adjusted with SSCALE_ROAD_ZS and SSTART_ROAD_ZS. The
! derivative of this function is used internally. This configurable function supports
! 200 datasets; if indices shown below are not used, e.g., (2), the current value of
! the index IROAD is used to identify the dataset when reading data.

ROAD_ZS_CONSTANT(1) 0 ; m ! [D] Constant elevation
ROAD_ZS_OFFSET(1)   0 ; m ! Offset added (after gain) to get elevation

! RR_SURF: Tire/road rolling resistance surface-effect coefficient. RR_SURF can be a
! nonlinear CARPET function of lateral position and station or a function of station
! (CONSTANT or TABLE) combined with a function RR_SURF_L of lateral position
! (CONSTANT or TABLE). Alternatively, a custom equation can be defined at runtime.
! RR_SURF from the calculation can be adjusted with RR_SURF_GAIN and RR_SURF_OFFSET.
! Station used in the calculation can be adjusted with SSCALE_RR_SURF and
! SSTART_RR_SURF. Lateral position used in the calculation can be adjusted with
! L_SCALE_RR_SURF and L_START_RR_SURF. This configurable function supports 200
! datasets; if indices shown below are not used, e.g., (2), the current value of the
! index IROAD is used to identify the dataset when reading data.

RR_SURF_CONSTANT(1) 1 ; - ! Constant RR_SURF component due to station
RR_SURF_GAIN(1)     1 ! Gain multiplied with calculated value to get RR_SURF
RR_SURF_OFFSET(1)   0 ; - ! Offset added (after gain) to get RR_SURF

! SPLINE X-Y TABLES FOR PATH SEGMENTS
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
! Following are up to 500 tables of X-Y global coordinates used to make spline
! segments for reference paths. Tables are listed here only if used in a path. If
! indices shown below are not used, e.g., SEGMENT_XY_TABLE(1), the current value
! of the index ITAB_XY is used to identify the table when reading data.

! NTAB_XY 1 ! CALC -- Current number of XY spline tables for path segments
