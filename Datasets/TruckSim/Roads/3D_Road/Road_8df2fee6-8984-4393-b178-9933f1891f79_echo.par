! CONFIGURABLE FUNCTIONS
!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

! MU_ROAD: Tire/road friction coefficient (MU) for a road surface. Use MU = -1 for
! original tire data (no scaling). MU can be a nonlinear CARPET function of lateral
! position and station or a function of station (CONSTANT or TABLE) combined with a
! function MU_ROAD_L of lateral position (CONSTANT or TABLE). Alternatively, a custom
! equation can be defined at runtime. MU from the calculation can be adjusted with
! MU_ROAD_GAIN and MU_ROAD_OFFSET. Station used in the calculation can be adjusted
! with SSCALE_MU_ROAD and SSTART_MU_ROAD. Lateral position used in the calculation
! can be adjusted with L_SCALE_MU_ROAD and L_START_MU_ROAD. This configurable
! function supports 200 datasets; if indices shown below are not used, e.g., (2), the
! current value of the index IROAD is used to identify the dataset when reading data.

MU_ROAD_CONSTANT(1) 0.85 ; - ! Constant MU component due to station
MU_ROAD_GAIN(1)     1 ! Gain multiplied with calculated value to get MU
MU_ROAD_OFFSET(1)   0 ; - ! Offset added (after gain) to get MU
MU_ROAD_COMBINE(1) ADD ! How to combine the two components
MU_ROAD_L_CONSTANT(1) 0 ; - ! Constant MU component due to lateral position

! ROAD_DZ: Incremental elevation added to a road surface. DZ can be a nonlinear
! CARPET function of lateral position and station or a function of station (CONSTANT,
! COEFFICIENT, or TABLE) combined with a function ROAD_DZ_L of lateral position
! (CONSTANT, COEFFICIENT, or TABLE). DZ from the calculation can be adjusted with
! ROAD_DZ_GAIN and ROAD_DZ_OFFSET. Station used in the calculation can be adjusted
! with SSCALE_ROAD_DZ and SSTART_ROAD_DZ. Lateral position used in the calculation
! can be adjusted with L_SCALE_ROAD_DZ and L_START_ROAD_DZ. The derivative of this
! function is used internally. This configurable function supports 200 datasets; if
! indices shown below are not used, e.g., (2), the current value of the index
! IROAD_DZ is used to identify the dataset when reading data.

ROAD_DZ_ID(1)       1  ! User-defined ID number for this dataset

! 2D variable width table: (data section) row 1 is a header for the 8 lanes of
! lateral position (m). Other rows have station (m) followed by 8 values of dZ (m).
! (column section) Row 1 is a header for the lanes. Other rows have station (m)
! followed by the values of lateral position (m).
