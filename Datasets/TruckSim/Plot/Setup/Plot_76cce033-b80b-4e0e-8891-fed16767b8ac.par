#EMBEDDED_NOTES
#The internal drive torques are applied to the driven wheels. They are reacted at the sprung mass with independent suspensions and at the unsprung mass for solid axles.
#
#The internal brake torques are applied to the wheels and always react against the unsprung mass. They always oppose the direction of wheel rotation.
#
#These ouput variables are associated with the user-defined import variables IMP_MYUSM_L1
#(L2, R1, R2), The import variables are moments applied to the wheels and reacting against the unsprung mass. The magnitude and sign are whatever you define in your extensions (VS Commands, Simulink, C Code, etc.)
#
#These imports allow you to define things like electric motors mounted on the suspension, the torque multiplication of a planetary gear on the suspension, brake and bearing drag, and many other effects.
