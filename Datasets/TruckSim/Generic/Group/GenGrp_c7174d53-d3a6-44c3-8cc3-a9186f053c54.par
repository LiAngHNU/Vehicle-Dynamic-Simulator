#EMBEDDED_NOTES
#There must be at least one road defined as part of the initialization
#
#In previous releases of TruckSim, this example used Opt_Road 0 to replace the road with a flat ground. However, since the support for the Legacy road grid has been dropped, Opt_Road can either be set to 1, or this line can be removed.
