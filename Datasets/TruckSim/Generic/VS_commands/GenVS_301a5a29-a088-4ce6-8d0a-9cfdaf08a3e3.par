#EMBEDDED_NOTES
#This dataset makes use of the internal TruckSim speed controller. The target speed is set to a constant to eliminate table lookup. However, the "constant" value is updated every time step with the EQ_OUT equation.
#
#Based on detections from the current sensor <<s>>, the target speed is either a constant speed limit assigned to the parameter SPEED_LIMIT (based on the initial target speed when this dataset is scanned), or a speed that will attempt to match the detected speed of the target in front.
#
#Rather than naming the detection variables for sensor 1 (e.g.,
#MagS1>_1, the equation is written for the current sensor <<s>>, where <<s>> is a symbol stack variable. This allows the dataset to be used with a sensor that might not be the first one defined.
#
#To see how these equations are presented to the VS Solver, please look at the Echo file near the end, where VS Commands are listed.
