#EMBEDDED_NOTES
#An axle will be lifted by adjusting the spring forces that normally push down on an axle.
#
#A new state variable is defined for lift force SV_F_LIFT. SV_F_LIFT is either ramping up, ramping down, or constant. It's derivative is DFDT_LIFT, which is given different values during the run via events.
#
#At some time T_UP, the lift force will ramp up.
#
#When a compression CMP_MAX is reached, the force will hold constant.
#
#When a time T_DOWN is reached, the lift force will ramp down.
#
#When the suspension jounce reaches a minimum JNC_MIN, the force will be set to zero.
#
#A separate set of VS Commands is used to subtract the lift force from the spring forces for the axle being lifted.
