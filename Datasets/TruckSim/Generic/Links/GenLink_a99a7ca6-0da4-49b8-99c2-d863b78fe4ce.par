#EMBEDDED_NOTES
#This example has two-lane roads intersecting, with one ending at the intersection.
#
#The network is built from three road datasets. Each represents a single lane (including the adjacent curb). The reference paths are on the left edge of the paths, which is the road centerline.
#
#Note that Path ID 2004 is used for articulated trucks. Rather than attempt a constant radius turn at the intersection, the path has the vehicle perform a wider turn to reduce or eliminate the trailer riding up on the inside curb.
