#EMBEDDED_NOTES
#This Double Lane Change path is used in the TruckSim Quick Start Guide, but is a common set of data used for comparisons of different vehicles and test conditions.
#
#The preview time of 0.6 second is a compromise between following a path closely (shorter time means more aggressive steering to follow the path in front of the vehicle) and remaining stable (longer time means less sensitivity to abrupt changes in the path).
#
#The target path is shown with a dashed line generated for the animator.
