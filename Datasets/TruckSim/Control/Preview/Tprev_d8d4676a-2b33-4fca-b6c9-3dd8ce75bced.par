#EMBEDDED_NOTES
#The driver model looks ahead at the target path over a distance that is based on a preview time and the current vehicle speed. For highway speeds, typical preview times are about 1 - 1.5 seconds. However, at low speeds, a more realistic preview is based on a constant preview distance.
#
#This dataset uses a 1 second preview time for speeds of 20 km/h and higher. The preview time increases at low speeds, to a maximum of 20 sec at 1 km/h.
