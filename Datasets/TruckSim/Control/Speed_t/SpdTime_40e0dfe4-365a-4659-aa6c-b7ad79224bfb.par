#EMBEDDED_NOTES
#With initial speed Vo and constant deceleration A, V(t) = Vo - A*t, and distance S(t) = Vo*t - A*t^2/2.
#
#This is a normalized table of target speed vs Station for intial speed  Vo = 1 and decel A = 1.
#
#To scale this plot, the Speed Gain should be the initial vehicle speed Vxz_Fwd, the Station gain should be Vxz_Fwd^2/A/2, and the Station offset should be the target stopping point.
