#EMBEDDED_NOTES
#Acceleration and Rate Sensors for the suspended cab, measured in the sprung mass coordinate system.
#
#The default location for motion sensors and reference points is the origin of the sprung mass coordinate system. With all fields blank, all sensors are located there.
#
#This Acceleration and Rate Sensors dataset specifically defines a single sensor for the suspended cab, at the vehicle's sprung mass coordinate system origin, and the sensor's orientation is set to 0 degrees in Roll, Pitch, and Yaw.
