#EMBEDDED_NOTES
#Once this Event is loaded, the brake cycles are completed and the vehicle is held at a stop with a constant 140 N of pedal force.
#
#This Event lasts 10 seconds, allowing the vehicle to come to equilibrium before stopping the test.
#
#It is common in physical testing to allow the instrumentation to continue to record for a short period of time once the test has completed. During the post-processing of the data, this can make it easier to ensure the test was in fact completed, as well as look for any effects due to the vehicle settling.
