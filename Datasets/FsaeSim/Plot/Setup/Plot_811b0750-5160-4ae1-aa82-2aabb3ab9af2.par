PTITLE Throttle: Closed Loop Speed Control

END_ENTITY Plot


#EMBEDDED_NOTES
#The variable "Throttle" is the sum of any throttle control calculated by the CarSim closed loop speed controller and any specified open-loop throttle.
#
#The source of open-loop throttle command may be from internal tables, VS commmands, or external sources like Simulink or the API.
#
#By using the sum of these 2 command sources you can implement things like driver aids for active safety that augment actions taken by the driver.
#
#The variable "Thrtl_SC" is the component ot the throttle command calculated by the internal speed controller in closed loop control.
#
#When switching between open loop and closed loop control, take care that no unintended open loop control is "left over" by supplying a data set that sets the open loop component to zero.
#
#The variable "Thr_Eng" is the value of "Throttle", optionally modified by the application of a time constant to simulate the transient delay in changes in engine torque.
